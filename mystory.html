<h1>This is my developer Story</h1>
<p>
  <ol>
      <li>I did some java coding on linux many years ago.</li>
      <li>My first html coding was done using Microsoft Frontpage as editor.</li>
            <li>When I found out about themes, I took a shortcut and started using <strong>wordpress/wix</strong> themes to make a website</li>
                  <li>Using themes was easy, but I learned nothing from them.</li>
                        <li>With the help of Refcode, I am learning again how to code, and how to build a website from scratch using<em> HTML, CSS, JS</em> without depending on readymade themes.</li>

  </ol>
