<h1>Your Domain is Ready!</h1>
<p>Congratulations! Your domain has finished propagating and you're ready to start building your site!</p>

<h2>How do I get started?</h2>

<!--
<p>If you're seeing this, then you have already purchased Shoutleaf hosting and your domain is correctly 
pointed to the Shoutleaf servers. The next step is to get all of your account info from the email that 
was sent to you. (If you don't see it, check your spam folder.) That email contains the details for your 
cPanel, your FTP account, and other important info. If you want to install WordPress or some other CMS, 
you will want to start by logging into your cPanel and using Softaculous, which will install it for you 
automatically. If you already have some files that you'd like to upload, then you'll want to use your 
favorite FTP client to connect to your site and begin uploading.</p>
-->

<p>You can safely delete this file whenever you want. If you want to create a "coming soon" page, rename it 
to "index.html" and edit it to say whatever you want.</p>
